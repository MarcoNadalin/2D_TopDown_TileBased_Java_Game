# 2D_TopDown_TileBased_Java_Game
This was a simple 2D top down tiles based game I made in Java in my free time.

This was intended to be completed as a learning experience, which is why only the following has been implemented:
* World creation and rendering
* Player sprite animations
* Player movement (with W, A, S and D keys)
* collision between player and solid world objects
* simple "camera"
